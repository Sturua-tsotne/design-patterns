####### Description

---
The Singleton pattern is a design pattern that restricts the instantiation of a class to a single instance and provides a global point of access to that instance. 
In other words, it ensures that only one object of a particular class is created, and that object can be accessed from anywhere in the application.

The Singleton pattern is commonly used in situations where it is necessary to ensure that there is only one instance of a class, 
such as when dealing with resources that are expensive to create, or when managing access to shared resources such as databases or network connections.
